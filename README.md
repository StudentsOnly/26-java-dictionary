## Exercise: Dictionary Using TreeSet

#### Objective:

Practice using TreeSet to implement a simple dictionary.

#### Description:

You are required to create a program that simulates a basic dictionary using a TreeSet. The program should allow users to add words to the dictionary, search for words, display the dictionary in alphabetical order, and exit the program.

#### Guidelines:

- Create a TreeSet to store words (strings).
- Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
    - Add a word
    - Search for a word
    - Display dictionary
    - Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

- To add a word, take input from the user and add it to the TreeSet.
- To search for a word, take input from the user and check if it exists in the TreeSet.
- To display the dictionary, iterate through the TreeSet and print each word.
- To exit, terminate the program.
- Handle input validation to prevent errors when searching for words, adding words, and handling menu options.
